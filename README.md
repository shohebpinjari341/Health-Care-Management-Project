Features of Health-Care Management
That sounds like a meaningful project, Shoaib! Creating a healthcare and blood donation platform can make a significant impact on communities by facilitating easier access to health services and promoting life-saving blood donations. Here are some steps and considerations to guide you through the process, focusing on using Java and Java frameworks for full-stack development:

1. Define the Scope and Features
Firstly, define the scope of your project. Decide on the core features your platform will offer. For a healthcare and blood donation project, consider including:

User registration and profiles for donors, recipients, and healthcare providers.
Blood donation requests and matching system to connect donors with recipients.
Health tips and information section related to blood donation and general health care.
Appointment scheduling for donations and health check-ups.
Notification system for blood donation drives, appointment reminders, etc.
2. Choose the Technology Stack
For a Java-based full-stack development, consider the following technologies:

Front-end: Angular or React (You can use JavaScript or TypeScript here, but for simplicity and alignment with Java-based backend, Angular might be more synergistic).
Back-end: Spring Boot (for creating restful APIs, security, data access)
Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL for relational data storage. Consider using JPA (with Hibernate) for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
Security: Use Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Additional Libraries/Frameworks: Consider using Spring Data JPA for database interactions, Thymeleaf for server-side Java templating (if needed), and Spring MVC for web applications.
3. Design the Application Architecture
Model-View-Controller (MVC): Use the MVC pattern for separating concerns and making your application more modular and manageable.
RESTful API Design: Design your backend to offer RESTful APIs to your frontend, facilitating a decoupled architecture that's easier to develop and maintain.
4. Set Up Development Environment
IDE: Use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development.
Version Control: Set up Git for version control and GitHub or GitLab for repository hosting.
Build Tools: Use Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies and building your project.
5. Implement the Features
Start by setting up the project structure:

Backend: Create a Spring Boot project, set up your database connections, and begin implementing your API endpoints, starting with user registration and login.
Frontend: Create a new Angular project (if you chose Angular) and set up routing, services for communicating with the backend, and components for your pages.
6. Testing
Unit Testing: Use JUnit and Mockito for the backend. For the frontend, use Jasmine and Karma.
Integration Testing: Use Spring Boot Test for backend integration tests.
End-to-End Testing: Consider using Selenium for end-to-end testing of your application.
7. Deployment
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize your application, making it easier to deploy and scale.
Cloud Services: Consider deploying your application on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, utilizing services like databases, computing instances, and storage.
8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD to automate testing and deployment processes.
Final Notes:
Documentation: Keep your project and API documentation up-to-date to facilitate easier maintenance and onboarding of new contributors.
Feedback Loop: Incorporate feedback from users and stakeholders regularly to improve and expand your project's features.
This project not only serves a noble cause but will also significantly contribute to your portfolio, showcasing your skills in full-stack development and your commitment to social welfare.
